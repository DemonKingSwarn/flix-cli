<i>for dependencies <a href="https://github.com/DemonKingSwarn/flix-cli#dependencies">(see below)</a>.</i>

This project can be installed on to your device via different mechanisms, these mechanisms are listed below in the order of ease.

## 1. PIP Installs Packages aka PIP Installation
```sh
pip install flix-cli
```

## 2. AUR (Arch Linux)

```sh
paru -S flix-cli
```

## 3. Scoop (Windows)

```ps
scoop install https://github.com/DemonKingSwarn/flix-cli/raw/refs/heads/master/flix-cli.json
